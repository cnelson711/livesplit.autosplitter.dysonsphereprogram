LiveSplit Autosplitter for Dyson Sphere Program

Has the following features:
 - Game time
 - Auto start (for new games only)
 - Auto reset (if you go back to main menu)
 - Auto splitting
   - Individual options to split on any technology or upgrade
   - Individual options to split when an item is first automatically produced (shows up in the statistics panel)
   - Individual options to split when an item is produced at a certain rate over a period of 1 second (example: Blue Science at 6/sec)

## Setup
Download LiveSplit here:
https://livesplit.org/

In LiveSplit, load the splits (.lss) and the layout (.lsl) from the right-click context menu.  If the game name is "Dyson Sphere Program", than you can access the autosplitter
that is fetched from GitHub through the "Edit Splits" > "Settings" menu.

## Customizing the .ASL
If you want to have custom rates, it should be fairly easy to open the autosplitter program (.asl) in notepad and adjust the rates manually.  The autosplitter is typically 
downloaded to: C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\LiveSplit_X.X.XX\Components\livesplit.autosplitter.dysonsphereprogram.asl

It probably makes sense to "Edit Splits" and "Deactivate" the automatically downloaded .asl file.  You can then add your modified AutoSplitter in your layout settings via
the "+" > "Control" > "Scriptable Auto Splitter".

## Discord

It's likely that this autosplitter will break as the game moves towards release.  You can chat with the developer if you are attempting to update it on this discord server:
